Semester 1, 2016

Group members: Kristof Mercier, Arianne Bulter, Chris Mykota Ried, Michael Graham, Samuel Horvatin.


Project: Robosport
  This project was a turn based tank game.  The goal of this course was to learn how proper documentation
  is done by a software engineering design team.

My Work on Documentation:

	For an example of exclusively my work look at the Interpreter section of the Design document.
	
My Work on Implementation:

	For an example of finalized code that I worked on, go to the Interprerter and InterpreterFunctions classes.
	
I did not do the unit testing for the InterpreterFunctiopns class, and had I continued to work on this project I would have redone them.
