Sam Horovatin Pair Programming with Michael Graham

    Pair programming with mike was an extremely insightful and positive experience. 
    It allowed me to understand the gameboard class to a higher degree than before.
    Through working through the math behind the hexagonal grid we where able to 
    come to a consensus that axial coordinates best fit what we had in mind. Overall
    I would say pair programing was an excellent method of coding for this portion
    of the project and would do it again in a heartbeat.

    Pair programming with Kristof was an excellent way to gain understanding of part of
    the system I had very little to no understanding of prior. As Kristof had been
    the main creator of the interpreter class, it was immensely enlightening to get
    explanations of functions and walk through the process during coding. Due to us
    both thing of the problem at the same time, we where able to come up with a novel 
    solution to the storage and execution of parsed Json strings. Overall,
    pair programming was essential (for me at least) to gain a deeper understanding
    of the system as a whole.
