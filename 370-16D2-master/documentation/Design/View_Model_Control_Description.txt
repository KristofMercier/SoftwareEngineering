View Description:	The view in our system encompasses any and all classes that display information 
to the screen. The view interacts with the controller to get information from the model. The view does 
not directly interact with model. Instead, the controller acts as an intermediate class, doing any model 
inquire or logical background work. The view contains the following classes:
*	StartMenu
*	SetupMenu
*	PassController
*	EndScreen
*	GameView

Model Description:	The model in our system encompasses all storage of information that can be 
modified during the course of the execution. Inquiries on information stored within the model are made 
by the controller, who will in turn make modifications to the content of the model. The model contains 
the following classes:
*	Robot
*	Team
*	GameBoard
*	StatsLogger

Controller Description: 		The controller in our system encompasses all logical operations and is 
the main brain in the system. It interacts with the model by inquiring about model content and modifies 
model content when appropriate. Any information needed by the view is given to the view from the 
controller. What the view is displaying is also dictated by the controller. Finally the controller is the only 
aspect of the architecture to communicate with the forth interpreter.

Interpreter Description:        The interpreter is an independent component that acts as a translation for 
Forth code so that it can be run on the system. The controller will call the interpreter when it runs a computer player robot's turn.
