Justification:
-want to avoid massive controllers that do everything
-put like controller activites together to increase cohesion -> all in game controls by players
-illegal input will be made impossibly by the game master + view so exception and error handling
in player input is not necessary

Description:
-handler of in game player input that calls the robots move functions based off of player input
-handles illegal moves by throwing an exception
-also handles player forfiet

Interactions:
robot: calls robot move functions
game view: recieves events from listeners in the game view
team: uses team for concede option

--Variables--
NONE!


--Functions--
move(coord, robot): calls the robots move function with parameter coord as turn
			  with the amount of turns neccesarry to complete the move
shoot(coord, robot): calls the robots shoot function with parameters coord
concede(team): kills all a gangs robots removing them from the game

risk:
illegal input isn't detected and a player makes an illegal move
