Justification:
-drawing of robots would make the game view class a mess
-able to use this abstract class with function over riding for a clean solution
-more portable -> if you want to add more robots just have them extend this
function -> easy to implement

Definition:
-an abstract class that is extended by 3 sub classes that draw a robot and (NICE TO HAVE ALERT) handles
it's animations if turning and moving

Interactions:
Game View: gets created in game view

--Variables--
NONE!!


--Functions--
DrawRobot(coord, COLOUR, turns): draws a tank at coordinate facing turn % 6 
	where 0 is the direction the robot was facing at the start of the game (based off teams enumerated colour type and mapping 
	each side of the hexagon to the enumerated value as shown below)
 	
	0
     ---
  5 /	  \ 1
  4 \	  / 2
     ---
	3


nice-to-haves:
-robot turns slowly to go to it's new destination
-robot plays a tread spinning animation while moving to it's direction
