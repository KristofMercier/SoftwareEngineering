The player is given a window to select a scout robot with two drop down menus: one listing all the teams to select from and another listing all the robots to select from.  The user must first select a team which will then enable the name drop down menu with the names of robots associated with that team as options.  If the user presses back they are sent to the Setup Menu Screen and if they press next they are sent to the Sniper Selection screen.  The Sniper Selection screen functions much the same as the Scout Selection screen differing only in back sending them back to the Scout Selection screen and next sending them to the Tank Selection screen.  The Tank Selection screen is once agian the same but with back sending the user back to the Sniper Selection screen and next returning the player to the Setup Menu screen with
all robots selected loaded in for that player (human or AI).
