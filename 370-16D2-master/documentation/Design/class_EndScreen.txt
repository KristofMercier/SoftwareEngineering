EndScreen Class:

1.	Description: EndScreen class is a view class that displays information about a match at the 
conclusion of a match. It also provides options on how the player could proceed.

The elements that are displayed by EndScreen are as follows:
*	A back button
*	A save stats button
*	A quit button
*	A stats table that displays the following in its cells:
o	Individual tanks statistic including how much damage taken/delivered, match 
survival, what team it was on, how many times it moved, and how many times 
its won and lost over all (including result of recently concluded game)
*	A single column table showing win/loss of teams

2.	Interactions present are:

*	All of EndScreenï¿½s input is handled by EndController
*	EndScreen  needs knowledge of StatsLogger information for display in stats table, 
provided by EndController

3.	No global class variables are needed for Start Menu

4.	The functions to be used in Start Menu are as follows (NA standing needed):

*	constructor (String *): setup initializes the page with all elements being displayed. It 
needs a structure of strings inputted to allow for proper initialization of stats table. 
String should be formatted as follows: Team, Name, Type, damage taken, damage 
delivered, (true or false) match survived, movements made, and if it won or lost. There 
should be a string in the structure for every tank in the game.
*	statsTable(String *): populates with given structure of strings.
*	buttonListener(): listens for any button press and signifies the appropriate controller 
function from endController



       Justification:
*	The endgame has a unique display element (Stats table) which no other view displays, 
thus an individual view class is needed to present this.
*	A separate view class is needed to conform to the design patter of MVC
