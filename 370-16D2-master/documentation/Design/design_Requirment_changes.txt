The changes that occurred between the design document and the requirements document are as 
follows:
*	On the start screen, it was previously described as displaying high scores on this screen. That 
feature has been subsequently cut as this information will be available to the player on the end 
screen and would clutter the main screen with information possibly useless to first time players.
*	On the start screen, the transition from the start screen and the setup menu has been altered. 
Originally a popup box inquiring into how many players that will play the game with a map 
graphic displaying team layout. This function has been moved onto the setup screen itself to 
help increase flow between views.
*	The above change of the start screen transition would affect the primary scenario 1.2, Setting up 
a Game. The profile selection and number of teams are now aspects of setting up the game, and 
as such should be in the layered portion of the 1.2 diagram for start button selection on the 
main screen.
*	On the setup menu, the selection of profile and robots has been changed slightly. The selection 
of player or AI controlled player entity is the same, but there is now a selection for NA, changing 
the total number of players in the match. This change will permeate to the number of player 
elements now displayed on the setup menu. The map, which is now displayed on setup screen, 
will update with any change in player elements, when appropriate.
*	On the main game view the general stats overview for all robots has been removed. The mouse 
over functionality for viewing stats is sufficient and the general stats overview would give the 
player information the AI would not have access to.
*	On the main game view there has been a concede button added to the attack and move 
grouping. This button, when pressed will remove that teams tanks from battle. There turn from 
thus on will be skipped as if they had no tanks left.
*	On the completion of a game, in the original requirements docs, it was stated that a statistical 
overview of the game as to appear overtop of the board. Well this view remains consistent with 
the one described, it is separated from game view completely. It does not appear above the 
game or as a dialog box above it; it is instead displayed in the same window as the game view, 
replacing it on the screen.
*	The original actors identified for the system are Robot Librarian, Computer Player, and Human 
Player. We have since identified a fourth actor, the Game Master. The Game Master would be 
the one to set up the environments for the game to be played. This includes setting up model 
structures, initializing views, and communicating with server systems. As this role is distinct, and 
encapsulates distinct actions of the system, the Game Master actor must be added.
