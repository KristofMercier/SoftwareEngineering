// Class: StartMenuController
--------------

What it is: The StartMenuController is responsible for the control of the StartMenu.

Why it is important: We decided that it would be best to have a controller for each view of the game. This way it reduces the overall size of the main controller (GameMaster), and reduces coupling.
