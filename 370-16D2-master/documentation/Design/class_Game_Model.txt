Description:
-the systems level game board
-player doesn't see
-contains the locations of all the robots


Justification:
-need someway to represent the game board on the systems level
-having a centralized place for storage simplifies design 
-using a hashmap looking up coordinates of robots and robots at coordinates is fast
	->needs to be done often


Interactions:
Team: needs a collection of all the robots 
game master: contains a copy of the game board for updating the view
SetupController:creates the game model initially
Robot: is used by: robot update coordinates


--Variables--
robotCoord<robotID, coord>: a hashmap that is keyed on robotID and returns the coord the robot occupies
robotOnCoord<coord, robots[]>:a hashmap that is keyed on a coord and returns a list of robots that are on that coord


--Functions--
GameBoard(teams[]): GameBoard:creates a game board

getRobotsAtCoord(coord): returns a list of robots at a coord
getRobotCoord(robotID): returns the coord of a robot
updateCoord(coord, robotID): update the coordinates of a robot
inRange(robotID): returns a list of robots in range of the given robot
