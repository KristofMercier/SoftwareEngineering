CMPT370 - Nov 29/16	
Meeting Agenda:
  - only a few more days before project is due so keep up the work
  - don't push stuff with errors
  - not much to talk about; at the point now where we are trying to get all parts working together
  - maybe schedule some more pair programming sessions for getting components working together?
