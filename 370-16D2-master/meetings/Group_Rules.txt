Group Rules

Meetings:
	Attendance:
	Group members must attend planned meetings unless two days notice is given.  
	In this case they must, according to the meeting agenda, provide a document 
	that will allow another group member to speak on their behalf during the 
	meeting.
	Preparation:	
	Group members must have read the meeting agenda in advance as well as made 
	preparations including written notes.  Group members should try to keep 
	their presentations during the meetings as brief as possible.
	Rules:
	People who have the floor to speak should not be interrupted unless they ask
	a question or their time is up. If there is something more to discuss, it 
	can be brought up after they have finished their presentation.

Assigned Tasks:
	Group members should be able to give at least a two day notice if they 
	cannot complete a task before a deadline.  Group members should also be 
	able to give an estimation as to how much time a task will take for them 
	to complete.

Communication:
	Group communication is to be done through Slack.  Group members are 
	expected to be able to respond to slack group messages in a short amount of
	time.  It is recommended to get the slack application for mobile devices, 
	but daily checking of the slack group is sufficient.
	
Etiquette:
    Group members are expected to treat each other with respect at all times, 
    and larger conflicts should be brought to the entire group.
    Group memebrs are also expected to be honest in there ability to complete a
    task or meet deadlines. If it is the case where by a group memeber cannot 
    meet a deadline, for whatever reason, they are to notify the group.
